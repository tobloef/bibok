### Modular build system for web projects, written in Node.js ðŸ“¦

## Goals

* This project follows my [Wheel Reinventor's Principles](https://github.com/tobloef/wheel-reinventors-principles): In short, it's made from scratch for learning and to tailor it to my specific use cases.
* **Extensibility:** Must be usable across multiple projects, with the possibility of creating project-specific extensions.
* **Vanilla JS:** Written ilain JavaScript with [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) annotations for type checking, no transpilation step necessary.

> [!WARNING]
> This project was created primarily for personal use. I would not recommend using it in any of your own applications (but let me know if you do!).

## Features

* Configuration-driven pipelines ([see example pipelines]()).
* Extensible module system ([list of built-in modules]()).
* Build once or continuously watch for changes.
* Support for both live reloading (refresh page) and hot reloading (swap changed assets out on the fly).
* Generate import maps for your dependencies (useful to load from `node_modules` for example).

## Usage

```
// TODO
```

## Limitations

* `require` is not supported, which can be problematic for certain dependencies.
