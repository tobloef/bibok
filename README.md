### Modular build system for web projects, written in Node.js ðŸ“¦

## Goals

* **Understand the system:** Fully understand the process by creating it from scratch, allowing for quickly making highly custom behaviour.
* **High extensibility:** Must be usable across many projects, with the possibility of creating project-specific modules.
* **Zero runtime dependencies:** Explore what modern Node.js and JavaScript are capable of natively.
* **No build step:** Plain JavaScript with JSDoc annotations for type checking.

> [!WARNING]
> This project was created primarily for personal use. I would not necessarily recommend using it in any of your own applications (but let me know if you do!).

## Features

* Configuration-driven pipelines ([see example pipelines]()).
* Extensible module system ([list of built-in modules]()).
* Build once or continuously watch for changes.
* Support for both live reloading (refresh page) and hot reloading (swap changed assets out on the fly).
