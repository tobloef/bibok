### Modular build system for web projects, written in Node.js ðŸ“¦

## Goals

* **Reinvent the wheel:** Fully understand the system by creating it from scratch, allowing for quickly making highly custom behaviour.
* **High extensibility:** Must be usable across many projects, with the possibility of creating project-specific extensions.
* **Zero third-party dependencies:** Explore what modern Node.js is capable of natively (except any libraries I create myself of course!).
* **Vanilla JS:** Plain JavaScript with [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) annotations for type checking, no transpilation step necessary.

> [!WARNING]
> This project was created primarily for personal use. I would not necessarily recommend using it in any of your own applications (but let me know if you do!).

## Features

* Configuration-driven pipelines ([see example pipelines]()).
* Extensible module system ([list of built-in modules]()).
* Build once or continuously watch for changes.
* Support for both live reloading (refresh page) and hot reloading (swap changed assets out on the fly).

## Usage
